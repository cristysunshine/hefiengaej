                            <p>So I want to run hunterborn, frostfall, and ineed, but I'm not sure if they are able to run in conjunction with requiem. I was wondering if anyone has any information.

A simple patch between Hunterborn, RND and Frostfall to make all edible foods have the required effects and eliminate the need for more than one patch between the three Ok so I'm doing an imperial/survivalist playthrough. I'm about 15-16 hours in when I keep receiving messages from Frostfall saying the scripting system is taking too long. So I uninstalled a few mods to try and clean my mod list up a bit, maybe take care of that problem. Continue playing. Frostfall is working swell. About two hours of playing after I make the changes, Hunterborn has stopped working. I can't search carcasses anymore. So I decide to try and turn Hunterborn off and on. It won't. I am currently playing a perma-death, hardcore run of Skyrim where I use quite a few mods to dramatically ramp up the difficulty of the game. Normally, manually starting the mods wouldn't be such a problem, but since I have to restart and re-roll a new character each time I die, manually restarting each mod is getting to be quite tedious.

I'm not sure if this is a load order issue or if I'm missing a patch, but I play with Hunterborn, iNeed, and Frostfall, and the stew recipes added by Hunterborn aren't giving me the warmth boost in Frostfall. I get the warmth boost from the teas, but I don't get them from any of the stews. Is this an issue for anyone.

Mod Vorstellung von den "Frostfall" dem "Ineed" und den "Hunterborn " Mod. Vielen Dank fürs schauen, konstruktive Kritik ist immer erwünscht dazu würde So, I currently use RND rather than iNeed, but I hear it's less script heavy, so I'm thinking I'd rather go with that. However, I play with Hunterborn, Frostfall and RND (I do have the megapatch for it). Is there a single patch for Requiem/Frostfall/Hunterborn or will I have to run the Requiem/Frostfall, the Requiem/Hunterborn and the Hunterborn/Frostfall patches.

Hi All, Problem: Crash to desktop pretty much immediately after starting Skyrim. I'm assuming the cause is a missing master file flagged by mod organizer. This Realistic Survival Experience mod: which integrates RND/Hunterborn/Frostfall into Requiem is looking for the master file chesko_frostfall.esp, but I think that might be an old name? The Frostfall esp file I downloaded is just called Frostfall.esp. So, is there a solution for this?

It crashes whenever I try to fast travel. It crashes when I try to enter inns. And sometimes it just crashes for no reason.

TL;DR: I'm looking for a follower that has opinions of their own and doesn't sound like they are just following me around, since I want to be playing as their follower. It started when I felt like playing a non-combatant role, focusing on Hunterborn/Frostfall survival play, crafting, becoming a bard, not killing people (undead and animals are allowed though). Generally living off the land. But I realized that it wouldn't take many hours for that to get old and run out of things

I'm not just talking about enhanced combat, but of the whole experience. When you think about it, there is no real way to balance the game without a complete overhaul.

Hey there I finally got down to installing Requiem and some other mods to accompany it. I only use mods which I saw in the Patch Central, here on Reddit or in some let's plays of 1.9.1 and 1.9.2. But I do have some weird stutter regarding sound and visuals. I did not play a lot but it seemed to only happen when I am near water. Water surfaces kind of slip in and out of glitching whenever I move around near them while looking at them, as if it becomes white for a split second So, I don't know what causes this, but I'm guessing it's a mod.
